## UFC Prediction Read me 

The code in this repository performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and showcases the usage of machine learning classifiers for analyzing mixed martial arts (MMA) fight data. The code utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It reads three CSV files containing MMA fight data, conducts initial data exploration, and provides insights into the number of fights and fighters present in the dataset. The code further visualizes various aspects of the data, including yearly fights, average fight duration, percentage of finish methods, and the distribution of fights across divisions and genders. It also explores fighters by country and analyzes fight details such as control time and competition duration per division. Additionally, the code imports machine learning classifiers and performance metrics, allowing users to experiment with machine learning models for predictive analysis. This code serves as a starting point for exploring and analyzing MMA fight data, and can be expanded upon for further analysis and model development.

## Job Recommendation

The code in this repository focuses on job recommendation based on text similarity. It utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and nltk to load, preprocess, and analyze job and applicant data. The code leverages TF-IDF and CountVectorizer techniques to calculate the similarity between job descriptions and applicant profiles. It also incorporates the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find the most similar jobs for a given applicant. The code provides flexibility in customizing the recommendation process by allowing the user to input a test applicant and obtain top job recommendations based on text similarity scores. The provided code can be used to build job recommendation systems by considering the textual information from job descriptions, applicant profiles, and their interests. It offers the ability to explore different text preprocessing techniques and vectorization approaches for fine-tuning the recommendation results. This code serves as a foundation for developing personalized job recommendation systems, enabling job seekers to discover relevant job opportunities that align with their skills and interests.# Projects

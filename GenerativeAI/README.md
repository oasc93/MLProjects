## Biology Chatbot

Welcome to Your Biology Study Companion! With over seven years of experience tutoring college students, I have created this project as a personalized study tool designed to assist you in your biology endeavors. The heart of this project is a custom-trained chatbot, expertly crafted to answer your biology questions. The journey begins with a PDF file being transformed into knowledge embeddings (in this case, the open-source 'Biology' textbook by Openstax), serving as the foundation of the chatbot's expertise. It ingests and understands this content and  stores these knowledge embeddings as vector stores, managed efficiently using FAIIS. The chatbot is brought to life using Meta's Llama 2, a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), with a user-friendly interface crafted with Chainlit. You can easily deploy this project on your CPU, ensuring accessibility for all. Embark on this exciting biology journey with your new study companion!

## Music Generator

Welcome to the Music Generator, a neural network powered by TensorFlow and Keras that specializes in MIDI file processing, time series analysis, and music generation. This sophisticated tool employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze MIDI files, interpret notes (including chords), durations, and offsets, and subsequently generate new MIDI compositions based on these musical elements. These tasks are achieved through an elaborate training process, where the model learns to categorize and understand various notes, chords, durations, and offsets found in input MIDI files. This Music Generator can be executed in two primary modes: training with your own MIDI files or generating music using pre-trained weights and data.
